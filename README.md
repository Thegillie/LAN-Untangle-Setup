Documentation and manual configuration of the untangle server for LAN. Created by David Gillispie, Kaleb Heinz
This has been created to help furutre IT students setup LAN.
## Before you get started
- Untangle does not give you the option to save a configuration file or a custom preset. It is for this reason that we have created this repository. We will list out the best practices and confugurations for you to ensure that your LAN event is flawless!


## Installation Steps 

### Step 1. 

The first thing you will need to do is ensure that your hardware meets the minimum requirements. They have been listed below.
If you are using a tower, ensure cooling will not be an issue. A 12 hour LAN event can be intensive on hardware if they are not cooled properly. Prevention is key, don't let your hardware fail on you!

 - 1-50 users: Standard PC hardware P4 or higher/RAM: 512 MB/HD: 20 GB

- 51-100 users: CPU: Dual Core/RAM: 2 GB/HD: 80 GB

- 101-150 users: CPU: 2+ Cores/RAM: 2 GB/HD: 80 GB

- 151-500 users: CPU: 4 Cores/RAM: >= 2 GB/HD: 80 GB

- 501-1500 users: CPU: >= 4 Cores/RAM: 4 GB/HD: 80 GB

- 1500+ users: CPU: > 4 Cores/RAM: >= 4 GB/HD: 80 GB

- Two network cards

### Step 2. 
The first step of installing Untangle NG Firewall is to download the ISO from their website. (You only have a 15 day trial for untangle, so set it up to get farmiliar with it. Then closer to the date of your LAN, reinstall it to get the trial renewed.)
